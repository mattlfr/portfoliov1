            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>At the end of 2022, I quit my job as a software engineer to go fulltime into building and scaling my own SaaS businesses. In the past, I pursued a double degree in computer science and business, interned at big tech companies in Silicon Valley, and competed in over 21 hackathons for fun. I also had the pleasure of being a part of the first ever in-person cohort of buildspace called buildspace sf1.</p>
